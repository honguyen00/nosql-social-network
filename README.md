# NoSQL-Social-Network

## Description
This project aim to familiarize myself with nosql database (in this case, we are using MongoDB) to handle the backend for a social networking platform. The backend is structured to store users' details, their friends, their thoughts (posts) and the reactions (comments) for a specific thought.<br/>
